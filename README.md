# Meridian Transfer Coordinator

**Meridian Transfer Coordinator** is a Clarity smart contract designed for managing secure and verifiable transfers between different on-chain participants. It features advanced mechanisms for validation, cryptographic proofing, conflict mediation, and contingency planning.

---

## 🌐 Overview

This protocol coordinates resource transfers between participants, enabling:

- **Secure entry creation** with expiration logic.
- **Reclamation** of expired entries.
- **Dispute resolution** with origin-target fairness logic.
- **Mediation capabilities** for admin controllers.
- **Advanced cryptographic verification** via secp256k1.
- **Confidential proof support** for high-value transfers.
- **Contingency planning** for inactive or compromised transfers.
- **Transfer responsibility reassignment** for dynamic participant shifts.

## 📦 Features

- ✅ Verified transfer entries with increment planning
- 🔒 Security enhancement for large transactions
- ⚖️ Dispute and mediation workflows
- 🔐 Confidential ZK-style verification
- 🔁 Reassignment of responsibility
- 🧾 Auxiliary metadata recording
- 🧭 Configurable access limits and system controls
